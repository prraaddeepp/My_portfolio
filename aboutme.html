        <h1>I am an international student from Nepal. I am a sophomore at Howard University and I am currently living in Washington,DC.<br> Being in a different country, I think I have grown as a person and I have learnt about different cultures overtime. <br> I love coding and I want to become a software engineer in the future. I started learning about computers in my high school. I was not sure about what I will be doing in the future. When I joined university, I was still unsure about my major. But after studying 'Introduction to Computer Science' in my freshman semester , I enjoyed coding and I figured that it is something I enjoy. I started taking more Computer Science courses and over these years, I have been learning and trying to become a better engineer everyday.I am trying to learn beautiful things in the field of technology and I have been exploring different career oppurtunities in this field as well.<br>
        Aside from coding, I really love reading novels and watching TV series. Breaking Bad is my favourite TV show and my favourite novel is 'The Kite Runner' by Khaled Hossini.<br>Fun Fact: I have watched Breaking Bad 10 times!!<br> I play Chess and enjoy reading about different Chess theories. I was a Chess Champion when I was studying in Grade 10 in my home country.
